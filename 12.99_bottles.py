#Using String interpolation is a process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string.

#For instance, if you have a template for saying hello to a person in an email like 'Hi {name}, nice to meet you!', you would like to replace the placeholder {name} with an actual name. This is string interpolation.

# String interpolation

for i in range(99,0,-1):
  print(f"{i} bottles of beer on the wall")
  print(f"{i} bottles of beer")
  print("Take one down, pass it around")
  print(f"{i-1} bottles of beer on the wall")
